      <p>Salutations! My name is Jose Arbelo, but if you're here you already knew that. 
        I am a young man in constant search of new experiences, information, and exciting new developments in technology.
        My passion for video games, anime, comics, and cinema served only to fuel my search, so it was no surprise to me that
        web development became my calling. It's just a shame that it didn't dial my number earlier! It is my desire that by
        getting to know me a little better and by viewing the projects myself and my colleagues have worked on that you too will discover
        the hunger that I know so well, and that we will one day work together on exciting new things! </p>
