# Responsive-Portfolio

Used the portfolio from Basic-Portfolio as a template to start off from. 
Added media queries to the css (thanks to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)
Still can't figure out my text being silly inside of my portfolio images. Bootstrap ftw!
